    "\n",
    "## Adminstration\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Introduction to Scientific Programming (ITSP) 2026 course. It is being offered as part of the Molecular Medicine PhD Programme.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course will cover both Python and R programming, as well as basics of the Linux operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dates and Times\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is a 5-day long course, and is split in to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Day 1: Python (Marcus Bloice, myself)\n",
    "- Day 2: Python\n",
    "- Day 3: R (Sereina Herzog)\n",

    "## LearnLab Server\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python and R parts of the course will be completed using the LearnLab server. The Python section will use Jupyter noteboboks - this very file is such a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are interactive web-based notebooks that allow you to run Python code within a web-browser. We will go over exactly what Jupyter is and how to use it a little bit later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebooks can be accessed via the LearnLab server, available at the following URL:\n",
    "\n",
    "<https://learnlab.medunigraz.at>\n",
    "\n",
    "Login with the following details:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Username: itsp + matriculation number, e.g. **itsp0731621**\n",
    "- Password: will be shown on whiteboard\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Access to the LearnLab will only be provided for the duration of the course! \n",
    "- Access to the LearnLab server is only available from within the Medical University of Graz and KAGes networks! If you wish to access from home, connect first the university network using your VPN account. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Materials\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish to download any of the notebooks, code, or slides, all materials can be found on GitHub under the following URL: <https://github.com/imigraz/ITSP-2026>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that access to the LearnLab server will only be available during course, if you wish to access the notebooks later, use the GitHub link above, as this will remain online permanently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "During the course we will complete short assignments. These will contribute to your grading. Also, there will be a homework assignment that will be given at the end of Day 2. You will have a few weeks to complete the assignment, the exact dates will be emailed to you. You will also be given assignments for the **R**, and **Linux** parts of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment will cover a programming task and you will have the choice of 3 different assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would highly recommend that you complete the assignment without the aid of ChatGPT etc.\n",

    "# Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Python section of the course, we will use **Jupyter**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Accoring to the Jupyter project's homepage:\n",
    "\n",
    "> JupyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. A modular design invites extensions to expand and enrich functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is based on the concept of notebooks. The very document is such a notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks consist of text, images, and code, organised in to cells. Therefore, there are **text cells**, and **code cells**. You can switch between the types of cells easily, which we will show later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with text cells. These cells allow you to add **text** and **images** to you documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "The text in text cells can be formatted using a type of text formatting language called **Markdown**. This gives you a lot of flexibility in terms of how you format your text, while being very simple and intuitive to use. We will discuss this now.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will take a look at text cells, code cells, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "A few key aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text cells and code cells\n",
    "- Edit mode\n",
    "- Keyboard shortcuts\n",
    "\n",
    "In Jupyter there are two main types of cells: **text cells**, like this cell here, and **code cells**. In text cells we can write aribtrary text, but also include images, tables, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Code cells are cells where you **write and execute code blocks**. We will see these a little bit later on, for now we will concentrate on text cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "In both cell types, you can press `Shift` + `Enter` to either execute the code in the case of a code cell, or render the text in the case of the text cell. This can also be achieved by clicking the ▶ button in the menu bar above.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now demonstrate these following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create new cells\n",
    "- Making a cell active\n",
    "- Executing a cell\n",
    "- Changing the cell type\n",
    "- Placing a cell above and below the current position\n",
    "- Hiding the output of a cell\n",
    "- Moving a cell up or down\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the IDE itself allows you to use tabs, open terminals, view data, and so on. You will see that Jupyter is a fully fledged IDE, with the ability to work on multiple tabs, open terminals, edit text files and source files, an so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now demonstrate how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a new notebook\n",
    "- Browse notebooks\n",
    "- Open a terminal\n",
    "- Open a dataset\n",
    "- Create a Python file\n",
    "- Upload and download files\n",
    "\n",
    "In the menu above, there are a lot of different options, however the most important items there are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run menu\n",
    "    - Run a cell\n",
    "    - Run all cells\n",
    "- File menu\n",
    "    - Download\n",
    "    - Convert\n",
    "- Kernel menu\n",
    "    - What is a kernel?\n",
    "    - Interrupt kernel\n",
    "    - Restart kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keyboard Shortcuts\n",
    "\n",
    "Useful shortcuts are:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the help menu, under Help -> Short Keyboard Shortcuts\n",
    "\n",
    "Some that are used a lot:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Esc`: exits edit mode.\n",
    "- `Enter`: enter edit mode\n",
    "- `Shift` + `Enter`: execute a cell / render a cell (or click ▶ in the menu above)\n",
    "- `A`: create a new cell **above**\n",
    "- `B`: create a new cell **below**\n",
    "- `D` + `D`: delete current cell (hit D twice in quick succession)\n",
    "- `Y`: Change cell to code cell\n",
    "- `M`: Change cell to text cell\n",
    "- `Shift` + `L`: show line numbers. This is useful for error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of these shortcuts assume you are **not** in edit mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** that all these options are available in the Edit menu above. For example, Edit -> Delete Cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you execute a code cell, it executes the Python code within the cell and shows its output.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you execute a text cell, it renders the cell. You can double click on a rendered cell to view its formatting source."

    "# Introduction to Programming Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will discuss very basic programming concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what exactly is programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generally speaking, is is a method by which you can tell a computer what to do\n",
    "- This is done by **algorithms** in the form of **code**\n",
    "- Code can be written in many different languages, for this part of the course we will use **Python**\n",
    "- Algorithms are sets of instructions, that are followed in order, such as a recipe for making pizza\n",
    "- In programming these instructions are \n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm is a clear, finite sequence of instructions that, when followed exactly, produces a specific result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take for example our pizza recipe example mentioned above.\n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm to make a pizza might look like this, followed, in order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gather ingredients (inputs).\n",
    "2. Prepare dough\n",
    "3. Add sauce and toppings.\n",
    "4. Bake for a set time and temperature.\n",
    "5. Serve pizza (output).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step is precise and ordered. You cannot skipping a step, nor can you reorder a step, or change a step, as it changes the result or might fail completely. Following the same steps with the same inputs produces the same pizza every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "The example above is linear and must be followed in exactly this order so that it works, but many algorimths have **branches**: these are algorithms that go one direction or another depending on a **condition**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take this for example: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gather ingredients (inputs)\n",
    "2. Prepare dough.\n",
    "3. Add sauce and toppings\n",
    "4. Put pizza in oven at 400°C\n",
    "5. After 10 minutes, check pizza temperature or appearance.\n",
    "    - **If** crust temperature ≥ X **or** crust is golden-brown → remove pizza from oven.\n",
    "    - **Else** → keep baking for 1 more minute, then **repeat step 5**.\n",
    "6. Serve pizza (output).\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen, whether/when we go to step 6, depends on the result of step 5. The branch depends on a couple of **conditions**, in this case the **temperature** or the **colour** of the pizza crust.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Programming Misconceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we move on to the some concrete programming examples in Python, we can address a few misconceptions about programming. For example, it is thought that programming is very difficult or that you need to be good at math to be good at programming. This is  not really true, as I hope we will see during this course. While it is true to say that programming in certain areas or fields can get very complicated, and some coding will require good math knowledge, for most people working in science, those who need to use programming as a tool, this is not the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw above, writing programs often involves breaking a problem down in to smaller steps. These individual steps are often quite manangeable, making even complex tasks solvable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will use the Python programming language. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is Python? \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a modern, simple, general purpose programming language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python was designed to have a simple syntax, and therefore it is not as verbose as languages such as **C++** or **Java**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few advantages of using Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Readable, simple to understand syntax\n",
    "- Large built-in library of functionality: a lot of very common tasks are built-in to Python\n",
    "- Extensive ecosystem of packages\n",
    "- Large community of users, finding help is easy\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, Python is a general purpose language. It can be seen in many fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data analysis and machine learning\n",
    "- Scientific computing\n",
    "- Web development\n",
    "- Automation and scripting\n",
    "- Education and prototyping\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, according to [Stack Overflow](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2025/technology#most-popular-technologies-language), a popular programming forum, Python is the 4th most popular language worldwide: \n",
    "\n",
    "![Language Popularity](./Images/languages.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we should also point out that the concepts we will learn during this course, are not specific to Python! Even though we will use Python throughout, the concepts you will learn are general concepts, that apply to all programming languages. You will also see this in the R section of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Programming Fundamentals \n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of computer science and programming, it is convention as a first programme to write the statement \"Hello, World!\" to the screen. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) the \"Hello, World!\" programme is\n",

    "The first thing you will need to do is install Python. On **macOS** or **Linux**, Python is built-in. You can just call Python from the command line and it will run your Python programmes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Under Windows, you will need to install Python. Simply go to:\n",

    "In this case it is Python 3.14.2, it might be different by the time you install Python yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In macOS and Linux typically a slightly older version of Python will be installed. However, generally speaking unless you are using the very latest features of the language in your code, older versions of Python will run most code just fine (within reason). \n",
    "\n",
    "Once Python is installed, you will be able to run Python programmes, such as a Python files ending in `.py` from the command line. You will do this using the `python` command line tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "The command line is built in to Windows, macOS, and Linux. It also called a **terminal**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: sometimes, you will need to run `python3` instead of `python` depending on your current setup. This is because some older versions of macOS, or Linux, have Python 2 installed as well as Python 3. Therefore, you need to explicitly run `python3` if you want to run the latest version of Python. However, this is rarely the case these days, and Python 3 is the only version of Python installed, and therefore the command `python` is what you will run.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example consider this simple example, `hello_world.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print('Hello, world!')\n",
    "```\n",

    "To execute this file, now that Python is installed, we use the `python` command followed by the name of the script/file you want to execute, as follows:\n",

    "### Passing Parameters to Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "If your programme requires parameters, these can also be passed along to the script from the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this we use `argv`, part of the system library `sys`, a built-in Python library. \n",

    "sys.argv[1] * sys.argv[2]\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `argparse` package\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want more control over arguments, use `argparse`\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to, for example, define named parameters, define default values, define the type of the parameter you expect, and other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import argparse\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create parser object\n",
    "parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define arguments here\n",
    "parser.add_argument(\"--threshold\", type=float, default=0.5)\n",
    "parser.add_argument(\"--steps\", type=int, default=100)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Parse the arguments\n",
    "args = parser.parse_args()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print\n",
    "print(args.threshold)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have two named parameters, `threshold` and `steps`, where `threshold` has been defined as a float and `steps` as an integer. Additionally, we have given both parameters default values, where `threshold` has a default value of `0.5` and `steps` has a default value of `100`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can do such things:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ python params.py --threshold=0.3 --steps=200\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of having named parameters is that the order does not matter. So we can also say:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ python params.py --steps=50 --threshold=0.9 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or (because we have defined default values), we can say:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ python params.py --steps=5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you pass the wrong type, you will get an exact error message:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ python params.py --steps=0.1\n",
    ">>> params.py: error: argument --steps: invalid int value: '0.1'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: there are several types you can use, including string, integer, float, but also a **choice** type which will only accept from a list of discrete values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, you can add help text to each of your parameters, so that when you execute the script using `--help` you will get an overview regarding each of your parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, with `argparse` you can write advanced scripts that accept many parameters quite easily, without complicated logic andhaving to write parsing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Interactive Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `-i` parameter, you can execute a script, but not exit after the script has completed. \n",
    "\n",
    "This can be useful for inspecting the state of the script. This can be done by running `dir()` for example, which prints all the variables currently defined. You can also redefine variables, and re-execute code, etc. when in interactive mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can look at this now using ther Terminal emulator included in Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Execute Inline Code\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also execute inline code directly from the command line without creating a file, using the `-c` parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "$ python -c \"print(2**10)\"\n",
    ">>> 1024\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it can be very useful to do file-based operations, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ python -c \"import os; print(len(os.listdir('.')))\"\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Installing Python Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "When you install Python, you will get a number of packages included by default. We have seen a few of these already, such as the `math` package. However, there are literally thousands of packages available for Python, that cater for every conceivable field.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find packages, you can use the official Python Package Index repository, known as PyPI:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <https://pypi.org>\n",
    "\n",
    "When you visit, you will see somethiong like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![PyPI](Images/pypi.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, there are nearly 750,000 packages available for Python. This is one of the reasons why Python is so widely used. All of these packages are free to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you were to search for NumPy for example, you'd get something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![PyPI NumPy](Images/pypi-numpy.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see some details about the project, and one crucial piece of information is the installation command:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pip install numpy`\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells you how you can install this package on to your computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "So what is `pip`? When you install Python, `pip` is also installed. This is the Python package installer, and allows you to install packages from the command line. Therefore, to install Numpy, we'd run the following on the command line / terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "C:\\> pip install numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And the package will be downloaded from PyPI.org and installed on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: by default `pip` will install the latest version of that package that is available. We will see later how you can install specific versions of a package, which can sometimes be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, while this works fine, generally speaking you do not want to install your packages directly to the default Python installation. You will want to install packages on a project by project basis. That means, for any larger project, you will set up what is known as a **virtual environment** and install your packages there. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will explain this in detail now.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Virtual Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "One aspect of using almost any programming language is how to deal with packages that you install. If you install all your packages to the default Python installation, you will eventually get to a situation where two packages require a different version of some other package. This results in a type of race condition, where if you install the required version for package B to work, package A will stop working, and vice versa. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this tends to happen when you have many hundreds of packages installed, and this can be mostly avoided by using virtual environments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual environments are isolated environments, that are project specific, where packages can be installed for that project alone. They will not conflict with packages from other environments, and can avoid the issue of dependency hell and depency conflicts. However, of course, it cannot completely solve this problem, but it will greatly reduce an issues you might have. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create a virtual enviroment, you use the `venv` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ python -m venv ProjectVirEnv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a new virtual environment called `ProjectVirEnv` in the current directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "The virtual environment is basically a clean, brand new new Python installation in the current directory, located in the `ProjectVirEnv` directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the virtual enviroment has been created, you need to activate it. In macOS and Linux, this is done as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ source ProjectVirEnv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Under Windows you need to run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ".\\ProjectVirEnv\\Scripts\\activate.bat\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will activate your virtual environment, you will see this because the prompt will change, and look something like the following\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(ProjectVirEnv) bloice@learnlab:~$ \n",
